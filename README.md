# Incredibly Secure Passwords

## Purpose of this application
Incredibly Secure Passwords is a nifty password generator that allows you to keep your various accounts safe from any potential breach. 
You can choose from multiple criteria in-line with your comfortability and even customize the length!

## The Journey!
I started off simple by declaring the variables needed in terms of password criteria. This was mainly just lower and upper case characters, numbers and symbols. Then I stored the password area into a variable so it could be selected later.

I decided early on that I would create a bit of a friednlier UI than alerts. I added the password criteria just above the generate button, and when it came time I added an alert if none of those were selected. This also limits the margin 
of error for users to encounter as it is impossible to select a length that isn't intended. The only alert that is features is if no password criteria are selected, the alert prompts the user to select as least one checkbox and then the 
page is refreshed for the user. I found this to be much easier on the user and more upfront.
